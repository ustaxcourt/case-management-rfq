# Case Management RFQ
Developing an RFQ to procure a new case management system for the United States Tax Court.

## Introduction

The United States Tax Court is an independent Federal court headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Court provides a national forum for the formal adjudication of disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service.

Like all courts, the Tax Court uses a case management system to manage its caseload. The current system is a legacy, non-web-based system. The Court intends to develop and deploy a new, web-based electronic filing and case management system that uses open source software.

Here we provide [a draft of the Request for Quotes (RFQ)](RFQ.md) that we intend to release to solicit software development services to build our new case management system.

We intend to release the final RFQ later this summer with responses due within 3-4 weeks of its release.

## Background

### What we're hoping to achieve as a result of this acquisition

We want a wholesale replacement of our case management system. Our goal is not to create a feature-level duplication of our legacy system, but instead to have a thoughtful software development process by which the various users of the system have their needs addressed. This is likely to involve substantial rethinking of some of our basic assumptions about what a case management system should do.

### How to respond

The purpose of posting this draft of the RFQ is to solicit feedback from any interested parties, including vendors of software development services.  It is our preference to receive feedback in the form of changes proposed as [pull requests](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfp/pulls), or by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfp/issues). In this way, feedback can be seen and discussed by anybody, instead of being available only to the Court. But for those who are uncomfortable with providing public comment on GitHub, or are unable to do so, we also accept comments via email at [clerk@ustaxcourt.gov](mailto:clerk@ustaxcourt.gov).

Note that we are _not_ seeking proposals at this time.

### Contract Term

The order will be for an initial period of one year, and the Court will have options to extend the initial period for a total of up to two additional years.

### Budget

The Court will pay up to $2 million for services during the first year, and up to $2 million during each of the two option years.
