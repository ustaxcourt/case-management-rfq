## Evaluation Criteria

### Submissions

#### Format

Submissions must be sent **by email to [clerk@ustaxcourt.gov](mailto:clerk@ustaxcourt.gov)**. Submissions must be in two (2) separate emails, one containing the Offeror’s technical submission, and the other containing the Offeror’s price submission. **Technical submissions and price submissions must be separate.**

The subject line of each email must clearly indicate whether the email contains the technical submission or the price submission. The price submission must be password-protected. The Contracting Officer or a designee will contact the Offeror to obtain the password.

The inclusion of caveats, assumptions, or exceptions to the requirements, in any part of either submission, may result in the Offeror not being considered for award, although the Court may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

#### Due Date and Time 

Submissions must be received by the Court on or before **5:00 p.m. EDT on Friday, August 24, 2018**. Any submission received after that date and time will not be considered, unless the Contracting Officer determines that consideration of the submission would not unduly delay the acquisition of the requested services.

#### Inquiries

Any prospective Offeror desiring a written explanation or interpretation of any aspect of this request for quotes may submit an inquiry **by email to [*clerk@ustaxcourt.gov*](mailto:clerk@ustaxcourt.gov)**, or by posting an inquiry on the Court’s GitHub site ([*https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq*](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq)). Any other form of communication initiated by a prospective Offeror concerning this request for quotes with any Tax Court staff member, Judge, or contractor during the period for submissions may result in disqualification of the prospective Offeror from consideration for award.

**All inquiries must be received by the Court or posted on GitHub on or before 5:00 p.m. EDT on Friday, August 17, 2018.** The Court reserves the right to determine whether, how, and when, to respond to any such inquiries. The Court is more likely to respond to inquiries that are submitted in advance of the August 17 deadline. If the Court determines that the information contained in a response to an inquiry would be material to a prospective Offeror, or that the absence of the information contained in a response would be prejudicial to other prospective Offerors, the Court will respond to the inquiry through an amendment to this RFQ that will be sent by email to all prospective Offerors who were provided the original RFQ, and will also be posted on the Court’s GitHub site.

#### Modifications, Revisions, and Withdrawals

Offers will be valid for one (1) year after submission. Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. Offerors may submit written modifications to their submissions at any time before the RFQ closing date and time, and, if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer, may submit written modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake, at any time before award.

#### Technical Submissions

Technical submissions must consist of a **technical proposal** of no more than four (4) pages, a **staffing plan** of no more than three (3) pages plus resumes and signed letters of intent to participate, and **references to one or more source code samples**. Technical submissions may also include user research plans and design artifacts.

The **technical proposal** must set forth the Offeror’s proposed approach to providing the services required, including the base software (if any) and programming language(s) the Offeror proposes to use. The technical proposal must also make clear that the Offeror understands the details of the project requirements. The technical proposal must also identify potential obstacles to efficient development and include plans to overcome those potential obstacles. The technical proposal must also include a description of the Offeror’s plans, if any, to provide services through a joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontractors.

The **staffing plan** must set forth the Offeror’s proposed approach to staffing the requirements of this project, including the titles of each of the labor categories proposed and proposed level of effort for each member of the Offeror’s development team. The staffing plan must also identify the proposed Project Manager and proposed Technical Lead by name, and include a resume for each. Those resumes must include a brief description of the experience and capability for each individual, but cannot exceed one (1) page in length each. Offerors proposing Key Personnel who are not currently employed by the Offeror or a teaming partner must include a signed letter of intent from the individual proposed as Key Personnel that he/she intends to participate in this project for at least one (1) year. The staffing plan must also set forth the extent to which the proposed team for this project was involved in the development of the source code referred to in the next paragraph.

The staffing plan must set forth and explain the extent to which the Offeror will provide individuals with experience in at least each of the following areas:

-   Agile development practices
-   Automated (unit/integration/end-to-end) testing
-   Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
-   Refactoring to minimize technical debt
-   Application Protocol Interface (API) development and documentation
-   Open-source software development
-   Cloud deployment
-   Open-source login/authentication services
-   Product management and strategy
-   Usability research, such as (but not limited to) contextual inquiry, stakeholder interviews, and usability testing
-   User experience design
-   Sketching, wireframing, and/or prototyping, and user-task flow development
-   Visual design
-   Content design and copywriting
-   Building and testing public facing sites and tools

The **references to one or more source code samples** must be either links to Git repositories (either credentialed or public) or to equivalent version-controlled repositories that provide the Court with the full revision history for all files. If an Offeror submits a link to a private Git repository hosted with GitHub, the Court will provide the Offeror with one or more GitHub user identities by email, and the Offeror will be expected to promptly provide the identified user(s) with access to the private Git repository.

The source code samples should be for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project contemplated here. The source code must have been developed by either (i) the Offeror itself, (ii) a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or (iii) an individual that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project. The Court would prefer that the source code samples have been for recent projects involving teams of approximately five (5) to nine (9) Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) personnel.

If the references to source code samples provided do not include associated references to user research plans and design artifacts demonstrating how ongoing user research was incorporated into the project, then the Offeror must submit a user research plan and design artifacts relating to at least one (1) of the source code samples provided.

#### Price Submissions

Price submissions must set forth a single dollar amount that represents the Offeror’s estimate of the total cost to the Court for the development services and travel expenses required for three (3) years of work on this project. To set forth that single dollar amount, each Offeror must complete all tabs of [the attached Excel workbook](Pricing_Template.xlsx). The first tab consists of the estimated amounts for the base year and the two (2) option years, and a total of those amounts. The next three (3) tabs consist of pricing templates to be completed by the Offeror, one for the base period, and one each for the two (2) option years. The amounts in the first tab, including the total expected cost, will be auto-populated based on the information provided by the Offeror on the other three (3) tabs.

Offerors must set forth on each of the tabs 2-4 of the Excel workbook the labor categories, the total number of hours per year for each labor category, and the applicable hourly rate for each of the individuals, that the Offeror proposes to use to provide development services for this project, for the base year and each of the two (2) option years. Although each tab 2-4 provides space for information regarding up to ten (10) separate labor categories, the Offeror should only submit hours and hourly labor rates for the labor categories for the individuals that it expects to use to provide services for this project. The Court expects that the labor categories and staffing levels set forth by the Offeror in the Excel workbook will be consistent with the Offeror’s staffing plan.

The Contractor will be compensated at loaded hourly rates. All proposed labor rates must be consistent with or lower than the Offeror’s current GSA Schedule rates, and must be fully burdened (inclusive of profit, fringe benefits, salary, indirect rates, and the GSA Contract Access Fee (CAF)). The Court seeks further price reductions and Most Favored Customer (MFC) pricing for all labor categories. Offerors should provide their best discounted rates in their submissions. The Court intends to evaluate proposals without discussions with Offerors, and therefore the Offeror’s initial proposal should contain the Offeror’s best terms. However, the Court reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary.

#### Interviews

The Offerors with the most highly rated written submissions will each be invited to participate in an interview as part of the evaluation process. Each interview will be conducted remotely via video connection and/or teleconference. The Court will communicate with certain Offerors to schedule the dates and times of interviews.

Each interview will include an unstructured question and answer session, during which Offerors will be asked questions about the technical aspects of their proposal and their approach to software development. The Court expects these interviews will assist the Court to assess the technical abilities of the proposed development team and to better understand the proposed technical approach described in the Offeror’s written submission. Both of the Offeror’s proposed Key Personnel must participate in the interview.

The Introductions phase of each interview will last approximately 5 minutes, during which the Offeror and Court interview team members will introduce themselves.

The Open Technical Session of each interview will last approximately 45 minutes, during which the Offeror interview team will respond to the Court’s questions related to the technical aspects of the Offeror’s proposal. Offerors will NOT be able to use or present any slides, graphs, charts, or other written presentation materials, including handouts. There will be no follow-up session for further questions after this part of the interview.

The Closing Remarks phase of each interview will last approximately 5 minutes, during which the Offeror may make a short presentation summarizing the Offeror’s responses to the Court’s questions.

Interviews will not constitute discussions. Statements made during an interview will not become part of the agreement.

### Basis of Award and Evaluation Factors

Each submission received by the Court will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Submissions that are determined to not be technically acceptable after the Offeror has been given the opportunity for a clarification will not be evaluated further.

Quotes must be realistic with respect to technical approach, staffing approach, and total price. Quotes that indicate a lack of understanding of the project requirements may not be considered for award. Quotes may indicate a lack of understanding of the project requirements if the staffing plan does not use a realistic mix of labor categories and hours, or if any proposed hourly labor rates are unrealistically high or low.

The Court will evaluate quotes that are technically acceptable on a competitive best value basis using a trade-off between technical and price factors. Technically acceptable submissions will be evaluated based on four (4) evaluation factors. These factors are

\(1) technical approach, (2) staffing approach, (3) similar experience, and (4) price. The three (3) technical, non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Court may make an award to an Offeror that demonstrates an advantage with respect to technical, non-price factors, even if such an award would result in a higher total price to the Court. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality between Offerors with respect to the non-price factors, or when the Offeror’s price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Court of the Offeror’s advantage in the non-price factors.

#### Technical Approach 

In evaluating an Offeror’s technical approach, the Court will consider (a) the quality of the Offeror’s plans to provide the open source, agile development services required, including user research and design, (b) the extent of the Offeror’s understanding of the details of the project requirements, and (c) the extent to which the Offeror has identified potential obstacles to efficient development, and has proposed realistic approaches to overcome those potential obstacles.

#### Staffing Approach

In evaluating an Offeror’s staffing approach, the Court will consider (a) the skills and experience of the Key Personnel and other individuals that the Offeror plans to use to provide the required services, (b) the mix of labor categories that will comprise the Offeror’s proposed development team, and (c) the Offeror’s proposed number of hours of services to be provided by each member of the Offeror’s proposed development team.

#### Similar Experience

In evaluating an Offeror’s similar experience, the Court will consider the extent to which the Offeror has recently provided software development services for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project described in this RFQ, and the quality of those services. In evaluating the quality of those services, the Court will consider, among other things, the revision history for all files in the source code samples provided. The Court will also consider the user research and design-related artifacts that were associated with the source code samples provided or submitted separately. In considering an Offeror’s similar experience, the Court may also consider information from any other source, including Offeror’s prior customers and public websites.

#### Price

In evaluating an Offeror’s price, the Court will consider the total of the Offeror’s estimated costs for the development services, and travel expenses proposed, for three (3) years of work on this project. This total amount will be on Tab 1 of the completed Excel workbook.
